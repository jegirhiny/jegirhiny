                Hello! My name is Jake. I'm an aspiring software engineer who loves creating. Introduced to programming in late 2020, 
                I became fascinated with code and began taking courses at <a href='https://www.wma.us/'>Wilbraham & Monson Academy</a> (my high school).
                After graduating, I took a decisive step and enrolled in the UMass Global <a href='https://www.umassglobal.edu/academic-programs/extended-education/software-engineering-bootcamp'>Software Engineering Bootcamp</a>. 
                Today, I'm excited to be actively working towards completing the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Away from the screens, I cherish quality time with friends and family. 
                Our adventures often involve scenic hikes, gatherings at <a href='https://www.noodlesnorthampton.com/'>Noodles</a> (a delightful local Asian eatery), 
                and the occasional high-stakes ultimate frisbee showdown. It's all about making lasting memories and savoring the excitement of each adventure.
